# Dolhouse

## What is Dolhouse?
*Dolhouse* is a project that aims to be a AIO library for working with files from Luigi's Mansion. It's currently in **early development**, and is therefore not really recommended for general usage.

------

## How do I use it?
Again, please keep in mind that the project is still in **early development**. But if you really want to start using *Dolhouse*, simply include the dll file in your project and you're good to go. To get the newest features and bugfixes, please download the source code and build the dll yourself. If something that has been considered **Completed** breaks or doesn't work as intended, please create a issue for it, thanks!
